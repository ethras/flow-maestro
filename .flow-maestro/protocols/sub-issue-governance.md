# Sub-Issue Governance Protocol

This protocol defines how Flow Maestro agents handle parent/child issue hierarchies in Linear, ensuring clear ownership, traceability, and quality across multi-issue workflows.

## Core Principle

**Sub-issues are the atomic unit of work. Parent issues are coordination umbrellas.**

Every unit of implementation, testing, documentation, and verification happens at the sub-issue level. Parent issues exist solely to organize, track, and reference the work done in their children.

## Glossary

- **Parent Issue / Epic**: A Linear issue that has one or more sub-issues attached. Contains no direct implementation work.
- **Sub-Issue / Child**: A Linear issue that is a child of a parent. Contains all implementation detail.
- **Terminal State**: A Linear issue state with type `completed` or `canceled`.
- **Non-Terminal State**: Any state that is not terminal (e.g., `unstarted`, `started`, `backlog`).
- **Atomic Unit of Work**: A single sub-issue representing 1-4 hours of focused implementation.

## Parent/Child Relationship Rules

### 1. Startup Discipline (MANDATORY)

**Rule**: Before editing code, running migrations, or producing documentation tied to a sub-issue, you MUST first call `startup` for that specific sub-issue.

**Process**:
1. If you receive a parent issue at startup, enumerate all `data.linear.issue.subIssues`.
2. Review each sub-issue's current state, scope, and last activity.
3. Select the sub-issue you intend to work on.
4. Call `startup({ issue: { id: "<sub-issue-id>" } })` for that specific child.
5. Proceed with implementation only after the sub-issue startup completes.

**Violations**:
- ‚ùå Starting work on a parent issue without calling startup on a child
- ‚ùå Implementing features without individual sub-issue context
- ‚ùå Assuming parent startup is sufficient for child work

**Valid Patterns**:
- ‚úÖ Parent startup ‚Üí enumerate children ‚Üí select child ‚Üí child startup ‚Üí implement
- ‚úÖ Direct child startup when you already know the sub-issue identifier

### 2. Logging Discipline (MANDATORY)

**Rule**: Post work logs on the specific sub-issue(s) affected. Parent logs should only summarize cross-cutting work and reference child logs by timestamp.

**Sub-Issue Logging** (where implementation happens):
- ‚úÖ All code changes
- ‚úÖ All decisions and rationale
- ‚úÖ All quality gate results (lint/test/build)
- ‚úÖ All discoveries and blockers
- ‚úÖ All verification steps
- ‚úÖ Complete "Work Log Update" with all sections populated

**Parent Logging** (coordination only):
- ‚úÖ Cross-cutting work affecting multiple children
- ‚úÖ References to child logs: "See FM-123 (2024-01-15 14:00) for API implementation"
- ‚úÖ Epic-level decisions impacting all children
- ‚úÖ Dependency tracking between children
- ‚ùå Implementation detail (should be in children)
- ‚ùå Code change lists (should be in children)
- ‚ùå Quality gate results (should be in children)

**Log Reference Format**:
```markdown
## Work Log Update - 2024-01-15 16:00 - (Agent)

#### Completed
- Coordinated authentication flow across sub-issues
- See FM-456 (2024-01-15 14:30) for JWT implementation
- See FM-457 (2024-01-15 15:15) for OAuth integration

#### Next Steps
- Resume FM-458 for session management
```

**Violations**:
- ‚ùå Logging implementation detail on parent
- ‚ùå Duplicating sub-issue logs on parent
- ‚ùå Logging on parent when only one child was touched

### 3. Context Manifest Placement (MANDATORY)

**Rule**: Technical context and implementation details live with the sub-issue. Parents contain only cross-cutting manifests or indexes pointing to child summaries.

**Sub-Issue Context Manifests** (technical detail):
- ‚úÖ Code architecture and entry points
- ‚úÖ Integration points and API contracts
- ‚úÖ Dependencies and external libraries
- ‚úÖ Implementation patterns and conventions
- ‚úÖ Testing strategy and verification steps
- ‚úÖ Security considerations and performance notes

**Parent Context Manifests** (coordination):
- ‚úÖ Overall feature architecture (high-level)
- ‚úÖ Index of sub-issue manifests with links
- ‚úÖ Cross-cutting concerns affecting all children
- ‚úÖ Epic-level acceptance criteria
- ‚ùå Detailed technical implementation (should be in children)

**Example Parent Manifest**:
```markdown
## Context Manifest - Parent Issue

### Feature: Authentication System

**Architecture Overview**:
Multi-component authentication system split across 3 sub-issues.

**Sub-Issue Context Manifests**:
- FM-456: JWT Implementation (see manifest dated 2024-01-15 14:00)
- FM-457: OAuth Integration (see manifest dated 2024-01-15 15:00)
- FM-458: Session Management (pending startup)

**Cross-Cutting Concerns**:
- All components must use shared `AuthConfig` interface
- Security review required before completion
- Integration tests span all three components
```

### 4. Completion Sequencing (MANDATORY)

**Rule**: Sub-issues must be completed first. Parents can only move to Review/Done after ALL children are in terminal states.

**Sub-Issue Completion Process**:
1. Complete implementation work on the sub-issue
2. Run quality gates (lint/test/build) and record results
3. Post final "Work Log Update" with all completed work
4. Run code review and resolve all üî¥ findings
5. Call `completion` tool for the sub-issue
6. Record completion timestamp in sub-issue comments

**Parent Completion Process**:
1. Verify EVERY sub-issue in `data.linear.issue.subIssues` is in terminal state
2. Confirm no children remain "In Progress" or "Blocked"
3. Post parent "Final Completion Summary" referencing child completions:
   ```markdown
   ## Final Completion Summary
   
   **Sub-Issue Completion Status**:
   - FM-456: Completed 2024-01-15 14:30 (all gates pass)
   - FM-457: Completed 2024-01-15 15:45 (lint override documented)
   - FM-458: Completed 2024-01-15 17:00 (all gates pass)
   
   **Verification**:
   - All child quality gates satisfied
   - Integration tests across components: PASS
   - Security review: PASS (see code review comment 2024-01-15 17:30)
   ```
4. Call `completion` tool for the parent

**Violations**:
- ‚ùå Attempting parent completion while children are non-terminal
- ‚ùå Completing parent without referencing child completion timestamps
- ‚ùå Skipping individual sub-issue quality gates

**Tool Enforcement**:
The `completion` tool will BLOCK parent completion with `PRECONDITION_FAILED` error if any children are non-terminal.

### 5. Quality Gate Attribution (MANDATORY)

**Rule**: Report lint/test/build results on the sub-issue you worked on. Parent completion should reference child gate results.

**Sub-Issue Quality Gates**:
```markdown
## Work Log Update - 2024-01-15 14:00 - (Agent)

#### Completed
- Implemented JWT service
- Added unit tests for token generation

#### Quality Gates
- Lint: PASS
- Test: PASS (12 new tests, all passing)
- Build: PASS
```

**Parent Quality Gate Summary**:
```markdown
## Final Completion Summary

**Quality Gates (Aggregated)**:
- FM-456: All gates pass (see log 2024-01-15 14:30)
- FM-457: Lint overridden due to legacy code (see completion comment)
- FM-458: All gates pass (see log 2024-01-15 17:00)
- Integration tests: PASS
```

### 6. Blocked State Handling (MANDATORY)

**Rule**: If a sub-issue cannot be completed, set that sub-issue's status to blocked, log the reason, and keep the parent open. Escalate blockers via parent log with links.

**Sub-Issue Blocking Process**:
1. Document the specific blocker in a Work Log Update on the sub-issue
2. Update the sub-issue status to "Blocked" (or appropriate blocked state)
3. Identify who/what can unblock (team, decision, dependency)
4. Post a coordination log on the parent referencing the blocked child

**Parent Coordination Log**:
```markdown
## Work Log Update - 2024-01-15 16:00 - (Agent)

#### Blockers
- FM-457 blocked on upstream API changes (see FM-457 log 2024-01-15 15:30)
- Waiting for Platform team to deploy endpoint /v2/oauth/authorize
- Impact: Authentication epic cannot complete until unblocked

#### Next Steps
- Coordinate with Platform team (@john) for deployment timeline
- Resume FM-458 (session management) in parallel if possible
```

**Violations**:
- ‚ùå Marking parent as "Done" while children are blocked
- ‚ùå Failing to document blocker on the specific sub-issue
- ‚ùå Not escalating blocker visibility to parent level

## Workflow Integration

### When Starting Work
1. If assigned a parent issue, enumerate `subIssues` immediately
2. Treat enumeration as Step 0 before planning any work
3. Call startup on the specific child you'll work on
4. Never proceed with implementation without child startup

### When Logging Progress
1. Determine: am I working on a parent or child?
2. If child: log ALL implementation detail here
3. If parent: log ONLY coordination and references to children

### When Resuming Work
1. If resuming a parent, re-enumerate all `subIssues`
2. Check for state changes since last session
3. Select next child to work on
4. Call startup on that child before proceeding

### When Completing Work
1. Complete each child individually (quality gates + review)
2. Only after ALL children are terminal, attempt parent completion
3. Parent completion must reference all child completions by timestamp

## Common Anti-Patterns

### ‚ùå "Parent-First Logging"
Logging implementation work on the parent instead of the child.

**Why it's wrong**: Future agents can't trace which code belongs to which sub-issue. Context is lost.

**Correct approach**: Log on the child, reference from parent.

### ‚ùå "Assumed Parent Startup"
Starting implementation work without calling startup on the specific sub-issue.

**Why it's wrong**: Missing sub-issue-specific context, acceptance criteria, and history.

**Correct approach**: Always call startup on the child before implementation.

### ‚ùå "Premature Parent Completion"
Attempting to complete a parent while children remain non-terminal.

**Why it's wrong**: Breaks project tracking, hides incomplete work.

**Correct approach**: Complete all children first, then parent references them.

### ‚ùå "Context Duplication"
Copying technical context from child to parent or vice versa.

**Why it's wrong**: Creates maintenance burden, leads to drift between copies.

**Correct approach**: Single source of truth (child), parent indexes it.

## Tool Behavior Summary

| Tool | Parent Issue Behavior | Child Issue Behavior |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **startup** | Warns about sub-issues, provides governance protocol | Normal startup flow |
| **logging** | Context-aware guidance: "log coordination only" | Context-aware guidance: "log all detail" |
| **resume** | Enumerates sub-issues, provides governance protocol | Normal resume flow |
| **completion** | BLOCKS if children non-terminal | Normal completion flow |
| **code_review** | Reviews parent-level coordination | Reviews child implementation |

## Success Criteria

A well-governed parent/child workflow exhibits:
- ‚úÖ Each sub-issue has individual startup before implementation
- ‚úÖ All implementation detail lives in sub-issue comments
- ‚úÖ Parent logs reference children by identifier + timestamp
- ‚úÖ Parent completion blocked until all children terminal
- ‚úÖ Quality gates reported on children, aggregated on parent
- ‚úÖ Context manifests detailed on children, indexed on parent
- ‚úÖ Blockers documented on affected child and escalated to parent

## Quick Reference Card

**Before working on a sub-issue**:
```
startup({ issue: { id: "<child-id>" } })
```

**Logging on a child**:
- Include: code, decisions, gates, verification
- Format: Full "Work Log Update" template

**Logging on a parent**:
- Include: cross-cutting work, child references
- Format: "See FM-123 (timestamp) for X"

**Completing a child**:
- Quality gates ‚Üí Code review ‚Üí Final log ‚Üí completion tool

**Completing a parent**:
- Verify all children terminal ‚Üí Reference child completions ‚Üí completion tool

**If blocked**:
- Log on child ‚Üí Update child status ‚Üí Escalate on parent

## 7. Automatic Data Provisioning (NEW)

The server now provides enhanced parent/child data in tool responses to support bidirectional information flow:

### Server-Provided Data

**Child Startup** (`data.parent_snapshot`):
- Parent issue metadata, description, updatedAt
- Full parent comment history for context extraction
- Sibling issues for integration awareness
- Parent comment cursors

**Parent Startup** (`data.child_activity`):
- Child identifier, title, state, stateType
- Last activity timestamp (from last work log)
- Blocker detection flag (`has_blocker`)

**Child Logging** (`meta.parent_context`):
- Parent issue ID and identifier
- Last parent activity timestamp
- Parent state
- Enables parent notification decision

**Parent Completion** (`data.child_completion_data`):
- Child identifier, title, completion timestamp
- Completion comment reference (id, timestamp)
- Quality gates detected (best-effort extraction)

### Agent Responsibility

The server provides structured data; **you interpret and decide**:

- **Parent ‚Üí Child**: Extract relevant parent context for child work (see `parent-child-information-flow` protocol)
- **Child ‚Üí Parent**: Decide when parent notification warranted based on significance
- **Parent Aggregation**: Aggregate child completions into parent summary

### Key Principle

**Server = Data Provider | Agent = Semantic Interpreter**

The server doesn't decide what's "relevant" or "important" - you do. Use the provided data structures to make intelligent decisions about information propagation between parent and child issues.
