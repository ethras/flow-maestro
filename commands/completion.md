# `/completion` ‚Äî Complete Issue

## Linear MCP Workflow

1. **Pre-Completion Verification**:
   - [ ] All success criteria met
   - [ ] Quality gates passed (lint/test/build)
   - [ ] Code review completed (`reviews_done: true`)
   - [ ] Final work log posted
   - [ ] For parents: All children terminal

2. **Post Completion Summary**: `create_comment_linear(issueId: "<issue-id>", body: "<summary>")`
   - What was implemented
   - Verification results (quality gates)
   - Code review status
   - Artifacts (PRs, commits)
   - Risks/follow-ups
   - Handoff notes

3. **Update Status**: `update_issue_linear(id: "<issue-id>", state: "Review")` or "Done"

4. **Clear State**: Write null to `.flow-maestro/cursor.json`

## Expected Output (Parent Issue)

```markdown
## Final Completion Summary

**Sub-Issue Completion**:
- FM-101 (JWT): Done (2024-01-15 14:30) - Gates: ‚úì‚úì‚úì

## Quality Gate Overrides

If gate fails due to pre-existing debt:

1. Attempt remediation first
2. Verify failure predates your work (git history)
3. Capture evidence
4. Document override:

```markdown
**Quality Gates**:
- Lint: ‚ö†Ô∏è OVERRIDE
  - Reason: Legacy warnings in src/legacy/OldComponent.tsx:45-67
  - Evidence: Documented in ISSUE-321, predates changes (commit abc123)
  - Remediation: Scheduled in Q2 2025 refactor
- Test: PASS
- Build: PASS
```

## Parent Completion Sequencing

**CRITICAL**: Parent BLOCKED if any children non-terminal

**Validation**:
- [ ] Every child has `state.type` = `completed` or `canceled`
- [ ] Each completed child has final completion summary
- [ ] Each child has quality gates passed (or documented overrides)
- [ ] Parent summary references ALL child completions

**If Blocked**:
```markdown
‚ùå COMPLETION BLOCKED

**Reason**: Sub-issues must complete first

**Non-Terminal Children**:
- FM-102 (OAuth): In Progress

**Next**: `/startup {"issue":{"id":"FM-102"}}` (complete child first)
```

---

## Confidence Assessment (Final)

```markdown
**Confidence Assessment**: 100% (6/6 criteria)
1. ‚úÖ Success Criteria: All acceptance criteria met
2. ‚úÖ Integration Points: Verified in integration tests
3. ‚úÖ Pattern Consistency: Code review confirmed
4. ‚úÖ Risk Mitigation: All risks addressed or tracked
5. ‚úÖ Sub-Issue Alignment: All children complete (parents only)
6. ‚úÖ Verification Plan: All quality gates passed

**Evidence**: See completion summary above
```

## Next Command Logic

- **Follow-up tasks needed**: `/task_creation`
- **Parent needs notification**: `/resume {"issue":{"id":"<parent-id>"}}`
- **All done**: Done (no next command)

## Reference

- **Protocols**: `protocols/sub-issue-governance.md`, `protocols/parent-child-information-flow.md`
- **Linear MCP**: `create_comment_linear`, `update_issue_linear`
- **State**: `.flow-maestro/cursor.json` (cleared after completion)
